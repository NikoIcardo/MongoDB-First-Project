# MongoDB First Project
 An introduction to MongoDB. 

The mongo.js file demonstrates how to connect to a database using base mongodb termonology with Node.js and Express. 
It also demonstrates vanilla creation of documents and collections.

However, a tool called mongoose shortens this code. The revised version of accomplishing the same connection and functionality is under mongoose.js.
